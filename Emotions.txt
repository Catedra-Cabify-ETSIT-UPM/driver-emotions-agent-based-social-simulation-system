- Feature extraction and data identification
REAL DRIVING EXPERIMENT
62 drivers
9.7 km route, 60 km/h speed limit 
SIMULATED DRIVING EXPERIMENT with similar conditions to the actual driving experiment
Both positive and negative emotions induced through graphical materials
Driving starts right after the emotion elicitation
Analysis of emotion induction through natural speech questioning, emotional self-report, facial expressions and behavioral action during driving 
ANGER: The behavioral performance wasradical. A high speed and a small following distancewere often selected, and the fluctuation of acceleration was big.
SURPRISE: atransient free state of driver’s consciousness wouldoccur and driver’s attention cannot be concentrated.The behavior choices were unconscionable. The vehi-cle’s movement situation could not be well cognized
FEAR: a slow speed and a safe following distance were selected. The driver desired to get rid ofthe current traffic situation as soon as possible
ANXIETY: the behavioral performance was radi-cal. The vehicle speed, acceleration, and following dis-tance would continue to fluctuate within a certainrange.
HELPLESSNESS: the vehicle speedand following distance cannot be controlled into a safeand reasonable range. The driver was in a timid state.The ability to control the traffic situation was poor,and the driver was easily affected by external environment.
CONTEMPT: the driver was full ofsuperiority and had a strong self-awareness.
RELIEF and PLEASURE:  reasonable speed and following distancewould be selected. The fluctuation of the accelerationwas small. Compared with relief, pleasure is a moreexcited emotion. Under the pleasure state, the behavioral performance was more radical



- The emotional side of cognitive distraction: Implications for road safety
30 participants
Simulated driving experiment 
Emotion elicitation through positive, neutral and negative words on billboards
SPEED: control, positive, negative, neutral (fastest to lowest speeds) **SEEMS CONTRADICTORY** 
STEERING WHEEL: negative, positive, control, neutral (more movement of the wheel deg/sec)
LANE POSITION: negative, control, positive, neutral (ability to mantain lane position from best to worst, more steering wheel activity after negative words resulted in better lane position mainteinance) 
RESPONSE TIME: negative, neutral, positive (worst to best response time)


- Determinants and consequences of drivers' emotions
Consequences on speed and risk evaluation
ANGER: speed increases, more risk taking behaviour, more perceived controllability that leads to a more optimistic risk appraisals
ANXIETY: not related to speed, higher risk evaluations
HAPPYNESS: not related to speed/risk evaluation

- An angry driver is not the same as a fearful driver
ANGER tends to provoke more driving errors than FEAR
Types of errors: Lane Keeping (LK), Traffic Rules (TR), Agressive Driving (AD), Collisions (CO)


- Emotional states of drivers and the impact on speed, acceleration andtraffic violations -> COVERS SPEED AND ACCELERATION WITH ANGER, ANXIETY AND FEAR
ANGER: speed and acceleration increase, more time speeding 
**Sometimes the presence of another cars interacting with the driver is enough to elicit anger 
CONTEMPT: similar effects to anger
**Contempt was especially strongerwhen another person was involved during the traffic situation andthere was no effect when no other driver was present
ANXIETY: changes driving behaviour often to worse: higher velocities, lateral acceleration and speeding
**Anxiety was elicited the most during safety-related situations with no otherdriver to blame
**Anxiety was expected to have a positive effect on those basic driving pat-terns due to fearful evaluations but the opposite could be observed
FRIGHT: stronger braking, reduced speed and stronger lateral acceleration right after the event that provokes the fright elicitation. 

- Effects of emotions on driving behavior ---> COVERS EVERY DRIVING TRAIT RELATED TO ANGER AND HAPPYNESS EXCEPT FOR THE BRAKING
ANGER, CALMNESS, HAPPYNESS
ANGER: reaction time (when braking) is low (JUST FOR ONE OF THE SIMULATION SYSTEMS), steering variability is high, speed is high, speed variability (which could be related to acceleration) is high
HAPPYNESS: high reaction time (not as high as being calm), steering variability is lower than being angry but higher than being calm, speed is low/appropiate, speed variability is low/appropiate
